    description: `
I'm Anika Somaia, a software engineer intern at LangChain working on AI observability products and a Neo Scholar (2025 cohort). Previously, I worked on generative video models at Pika.

&nbsp;

I'm currently on leave from Columbia University, where I study Computer Science and Math, serve as research lead at Columbia's AI Alignment Club, and play tennis. 

&nbsp;

I also enjoy pretty much anything outdoors (especially snowboarding and kitesurfing) and traveling to new places.

    description: `
I'm Anika Somaia, a junior at Columbia studying Computer Science and Math, and a Neo Scholar (2025 cohort).

&nbsp;

I'm working on models at DeepMind this summer. Previously, I worked on AI observability products at LangChain, and generative video models at Pika.

&nbsp;

At Columbia, I research agent failure at DAPLab, lead the AI Alignment Club, and am part of Columbia's entrepreneurship club, CORE.

&nbsp;

I enjoy pretty much anything outdoors, especially snowboarding and kitesurfing.
